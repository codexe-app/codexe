Too much information running through my brain

## Overview

## Install

If you would like to set up your own CODEXE server, you will need an AWS account. Fork this repo into your GIT, then goto the AWS Amplify Console and create a (GEN 1) app.  Then point the app to the repo, and it will start building everything.
